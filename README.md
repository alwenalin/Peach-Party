# Peach-Party
This project is a two-player competitive game inspired by Mario Party, featuring powered-up squares, Bowser, Boo, and vortex attacks on moving enemies. Players choose from 9 different boards, collecting or losing stars and coins as they navigate the game. I implemented object-oriented programming with multiple classes for a well-structured system in managing board displays, characters, powers, and scores to ensure smooth gameplay.
